## 🚀 About Me

I’m currently pursuing a Higher Diploma in Computing at Griffith College, Dublin, with a strong focus on **front-end development** and user-centric design. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive, and accessible interfaces. With a background in healthcare and IT support, I bring empathy, problem-solving, and analytical thinking to every project.

I'm also exploring **data analytics** using **SQL**, and I love applying that knowledge to support intuitive UI design, dashboards, and interactive tools.
